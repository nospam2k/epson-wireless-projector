Project image on Epson Wireless projectors (tested on EX5220)

This is the source code for connecting to an Epson Wireless projector. It is only a demo of how to search, connect and project an image.

It is written in Java and the Android code uses Epson's JniLibs (not included) from Epsons iProjection app (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.epson.iprojection&hl=en) but they are not necessary. The Android code is only included for educational purposes only. As such, there is a lot of remmed out code that may be useful for further development.
